          <p><strong>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you  (1.) Got blocked on a simple problem</strong></p>
          <p>The JavaScript Racer game is my most recent example of getting stuck on a seemingly simple problem.</p>
          <p>My JS didn’t seem to run on my first attempt, the alert box didn’t even pop up to get the ball rolling with setting up the track size. One my second attempt, I got as far as being able to have the track built, and some CSS saying on the background running, but not everything. No space ship, no planet target.</p>
          <p>The problem solving techniques I used were pseudocode, googling, Rubber ducking, reading what scant error codes there were, did i mention googling? Asking my peers for help in the end, and from a coach for un-blocking.</p>
          <p>But the last two I’ve felt bad about doing because of pride I think. I’ve just been trying to box-on. “If others can do it so can I…?”</p>
          <p>I’ve felt terrible to be honest. I usually like to feel capable, and able to work through stuff. But I’ve felt stumped, and ashamed to look at other peers work, and to ask for help.</p>
          <p>I’m glad for the meditation techniques though. I think I need to get to that accurate assessment place, to see my current weakness, and be in a confident place to ask for help when needed. Ask for help earlier I think is the thing I’ve learnt most.</p>
          <p>2. Solved a problem in an elegant way This is a non-coding problem, as I don’t think I’ve solved anything elegantly yet.</p>
          <p>This was a problem of wastage at my workplace. We had paper slips being made at great effort to use as place holders for paying orders ‘once’, and then thrown away.</p>
          <p>I proposed a couple of solutions, the first of which didn’t fly, but with a bit of team work, came up with laminated colour-coded slips that could be re-used. saved the old production time and saved the wastage. Problem solved elegantly and effectively.</p>
          <p>I felt great through the process. Challenged at first, but euphoric the closer we got to the final solution.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>Psuedocode -</strong> not too confident, as I’m still finding my feet with the vocabulary.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>Trying something -</strong> I did that, but it’s hard not knowing which way is up.</p>
          <p></p>
          <P><strong>Rubber ducky method -</strong> this was good, I found some problems using this.</P>
          <p></p>
          <P><strong>Reading error messages -</strong> it’s more the absence of error messages that I found hard.</P>
          <p></p>
          <P><strong>Console.logging -</strong> I’m finding this difficult, as it doesn’t seem to connect for me sometimes.</P>
          <p></p>
          <P><strong>Googling -</strong> so so, knowing the question to ask is the first step.</P>
          <p></p>
          <P><strong>Asking your peers for help -</strong> this was hard. I felt whakama about it.</P>
          <p></p>
          <P><strong>Asking coaches for help -</strong> this is a great step, but it took me a long time to get comfortable with the idea.</P>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <P><strong>Improving your process with reflection -</strong> yes, I think this is good, but i can get stuck in loops sometimes.</P>
          <p></p>
          <P><strong>Explain to your non-tech friend , using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</strong></P>
          <p><strong>.map() -</strong> This function makes a new array of results from each element having a function run over each item in the original array.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>.filter() -</strong> This function makes a new array of just the filtered items, named as the filter.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>.reduce()</strong>This function reduces arrays to single numbers, or flattens nested arrays, with the use of a reducer and a function. This reducer runs the function across the array, calling over the array until the single result is achieved.</p>
