          <p><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></p>
          <p>They are the same thing, or described as pretty much the same thing.  Mindfulness brings purposeful attention to a point of focus, a trained ability to focus. Self awareness is informed by emotional awareness, and is the ability to look at yourself without judgment.</p>
          <p><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></p>
          <p>The body scan was easy to do, and surprisingly relaxing. Each body part I brought attention to seemed to relax a little bit.</p>
          <p>I felt it was a neat way of connecting emotions to my body. I could feel the tension in my back I wasn’t consciously aware of.</p>
          <p>Relaxing my back seemed to help identify some emotional tension I possibly have stored up in my back, as a result of struggling with the game assignment this week.</p>
          <p><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</strong></p>
          <p>This was a great section, subtile changes in perception can have fundamental implications. Such as “Emotions are simply what you feel, not what you are.”</p>
          <p>They are physiological phenomena that I can act upon, they do not constitute the core of my being.</p>
          <p>My favourite quote was this:</p>
          <p>“Thoughts and emotions are like clouds—some beautiful, some dark—while our core being is like the sky. Clouds are not the sky; they are phenomena in the sky that come and go. Similarly, thoughts and emotions are not who we are...”</p>
